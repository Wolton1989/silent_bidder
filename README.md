This repository contains a Python-based silent auction program. The program allows multiple users to place bids and determines the highest bidder at the end of the auction.

Features
Logo Display: Displays a logo at the beginning of the program.
Bid Recording: Accepts bids from multiple users.
Console Clearing: Clears the console after each bid to keep the interface clean.
Highest Bidder Announcement: Determines and announces the highest bidder once all bids are submitted.
How It Works
Logo Display: The program starts by displaying a logo (imported from art2 module).
Bid Collection: Users are prompted to enter their names and bid amounts.
Continuing Bids: After each bid, the program asks if there are any more bidders.
If Yes, the console is cleared and the next user can place their bid.
If No, the program announces the highest bidder and their bid amount.
